# ProducerConsumerErlang
The problem producer consumer implemented in erlang.

## About this cool project

Well, is my first project using Erlang so is probably a little bad (or a shit).

## Installation 

To run this 'application' you must go to directory of this project, compile all files and run app.erl, something like this:

```
pwd([YourDirectory]).
c(brewery).
c(consumer).
c(filehelper).
c(producer).
c(str).
c(app).
app:init().
```

And then you'll see a log.
Each process will create a log file, something like this: process_1 (<0.48.0>).txt
